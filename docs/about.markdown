# About Me

Hi, I'm Nick Owens. I'm a mechanical engineering and computer science student at Southern Illinois University. My current interests include digital engineering, robotics, computer-aided design, and computational fluid dynamics. I participate in my local chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the chassis design subteam on my school's Formula SAE project team. When I'm not working on classes, research, or projects, I am usually hiking, drawing, building a Lego set, or cuddling with my dogs.
